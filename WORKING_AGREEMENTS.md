# Group 11 Working Agreements #


- All team members are encouraged to participate without fear of judgement.
  - Both sides of the Treaty needed to have their say.  Our team would like each member to proactively get involved so that all of our ideas and input are respected.  
- Encourage team members to sing out for help and/or clarification.
  - There were some chiefs who didn't sign the treaty or participate.  We want to ensure all team members speak up if we don't agree or if we need support.  
- Ideas and participants should be treated as equals.
  - The Treaty of Waitangi was designed to bring an end to inequality.  We want to avoid those same problems in our project. 
- Provide constructive criticism instead of just criticism. Be careful how we relay feedback.
  - The Treaty was a result of war and conflict.  We want to maintain peace so that we get a positive outcome from first try. 
- Respect our different ways of communicating and create clear understanding before undertaking any tasks.
  - The Treaty was written in English and then translated to Maori, meaning that there has been confusion over the interpretation. We want to ensure we have clear communication and understanding prior to making decisions. 
- All team members are open minded with a growth mindset.
  - The Treaty is an evolving agreement. Our team will be adaptable to change and learning from one another.
